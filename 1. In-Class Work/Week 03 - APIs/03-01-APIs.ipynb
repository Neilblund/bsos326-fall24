    "# API and HTTP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are systems that allow computer programs to interact with one another. Many organizations that maintain large databases available on the internet will also provide an API that is designed to allow users to retrieve, post, or modify data by sending queries programmatically. For instance: you can get a list of current members of Congress by directing your web browser to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%5B%22118%22%5D%2C%22source%22%3A%22members%22%7D\">Congress.gov</a> and using the search bar, but you could also write a Python program that queries <a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/blob/main/Documentation/MemberEndpoint.md\">the Congress.gov API</a> and retrieves the same information. Learning how to navigate these systems makes it very easy to collect data and analyze data from the web.\n",
