These are the more traditional visualizations and most commonly used within reports (after all, you can't animate figures on a piece of paper ... at least not yet!).\n",

Dynamic visualizations can open up a whole new dimension and allow you to show relationships and trends more clearly than with a static visualization. In addition, they can be more flexible and allow for customization of different views of the data much more easily than creating any individual static visualizations.\n",
