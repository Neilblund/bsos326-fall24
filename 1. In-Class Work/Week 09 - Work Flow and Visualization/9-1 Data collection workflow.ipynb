So you would write something like `offset=0&limit=100` to get results 1-100, and then you would increment that by 100 (`offset=100&limit=100`) to get 101 through 200 and so on and you would continue until your offset was greater than or equal to the maximum number of responses. \n",

The PokeApi is a good example of this: we retrieved a list of names and URLs, but if we navigate to any one of those URLs we'll get even more detailed information about the selected Pokemon. So if we wanted to create a data set with detailed information on each Pokemon, we would need to iterate over all of these URLs and then format all of our results in data frame.
