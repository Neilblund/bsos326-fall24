    "We'll start with a basic histogram. A histogram is useful for looking at the distribution of a numerical variable (that is, a variable that takes numbers as its values as opposed to categories). They can visually represent the spread and center of the variable, as well as provide insights to the shape of the distribution. For example, we can look at the number of **modes**, or peaks, in the data, which wouldn't be captured in numerical summaries such as mean or variance. We can also get a better idea of the **skew** of the data, determining whether most units are grouped on the left or right side (lower or higher values), or whether it's mostly symmetrical. "
