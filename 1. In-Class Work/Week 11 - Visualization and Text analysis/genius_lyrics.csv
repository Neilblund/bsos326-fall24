Eminem,Rap God,rap,https://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics," ""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"" ""But I'm only going to get this one chance""   ( Six minutes—, six minutes— ) ""Something's wrong, I can feel it""   ( Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on! ) ""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.  If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;  And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"" ""You are just what the doc ordered""  I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot  But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic ( Kill 'em all with ) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got  Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!) MCs get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme"" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you,  they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of  shame You fags think it's all a game,   'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and,   tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-lookin' boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!) You're witnessin' a mass-occur Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy ""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy? I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face, lookin' boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause— I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard  So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin You rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off, then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep-throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin' in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from  The Mathers LP 1  when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was,   but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya,   like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed ( J.J. Fad ) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,   you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber   so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he's too mainstream."" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock,   shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use."" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues,   but it's still tongue-in-cheek,   fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then? Don't mistake him for  Satan It's a fatal mistake   if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?"

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck That same mentality I told my brother not to duck In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin In pajamas and dun-ta-duns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs  dumb Niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted This Piru shit been in me forever So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop, I hope—    Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it  Section.80 The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" What's crazy was I was hearin' about it But doubted your ignorance How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?

I’m about to change your life  Then by all means, lead the way  Number one!  I’m a girl in a world in which My only job is to marry rich My father has no sons so I’m the one Who has to social climb for one So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious And Alexander is penniless Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less  Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you  Schuyler?  My sister  Number two!  He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister That elevates his status ,  I’d Have to be naïve to set that aside Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza Now that’s his bride Nice going, Angelica, he was right You will never be satisfied  Thank you for all your service  If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it  I’ll leave you to it  Number three!  I know my sister like I know my own mind You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned He’d be mine She would say, “I’m fine”  She’d be lying  But when I fantasize at night It’s Alexander’s eyes As I romanticize   what might Have been if I hadn’t sized him Up so quickly At least my dear Eliza’s his wife; At least I keep his eyes in my life…  He will never be satisfied I will never be satisfied  To the groom!

I'm reaching out for you  I'm just so fucking depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down then I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt To vent, but I just can't admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow,  but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles— In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so  I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor Everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room, just as soon as I walk in,   it's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact 'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door For conversation like I want that I'm not lookin' for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin' man servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha! Marshall, you're so funny, man You should be a comedian, goddamn!"" Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles— In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so  Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip 'em, don't expect no help Now, I could've either just sat On my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in In every single place, every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant actin' stupid Aunt Edna always told me: ""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."" Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen Stop sign pole at eight-years-old I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't Tryin' to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description 'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' It's probably a 110% different I guess we would have to walk a Mile in each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10's Let's see if you can fit your feet— In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so  Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own ( Oh ) Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone ( So ) Are you calling me? Are you tryin' to get through? ( Oh ) Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you ( So )  Yeah To my babies: Stay strong Your Dad'll be home soon And to the rest of the world: God gave you shoes To fit you So put 'em on and wear 'em Be yourself, man Be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Don't never let no one tell you You ain't beautiful  ( So-oh-oh-oh-oh )"

(A tale as old as time) I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning (For the last time)  It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime, everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero  I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out ""She's laughing up at us from Hell""  It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees It's me, hi (Hi) I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees) I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"
Don McLean,American Pie,rock,https://genius.com/Don-mclean-american-pie-lyrics," A long, long time ago I can still remember how that music Used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Did you write the book of love?

Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?
