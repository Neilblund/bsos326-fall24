    "1) **Jupyter notebooks are useful for including narrative text alongside executable code.** This means it is easier to describe and show programming concepts all at once. So, it is useful for educational purposes.\n",
    "2) **JupyterHub and JupyterLab make sharing notebooks and code easier.** You can feel free to download these notebooks, download and install Jupyter on your computers, and run them locally. However, you will also need to make sure that you install all the same packages and make sure that you are running appropriate versions of each to make sure it is compatible. Using the same environment makes all of this easier to do.\n",
    "3) **Jupyter notebooks are good for documentation and reproducibility.** Even outside of educational contexts, Jupyter notebooks are commonly used to document and run code, especially for data analysis. This is because reproducibility and transparency in research is very important, and Jupyter notebooks make that much easier. There's a lot of collaboration that happens when programming and doing data analysis, and Jupyter notebooks have become more and more popular as a way to make that easier.\n",
