The New York Times API has Op-Eds that were published in the New York Times, which you could use text analysis to analyze. You might also consider scraping the text from some other sources. You could consider what has been posted on social media sites such as Reddit. These can all be combined temporally to see what the trends are like to get a better idea of what might be an indicator of success, especially as it applies to the 2024 election. "
